INTRODUCTION: From a safety perspective, the pandemic imposed atypical work 
dynamics that led to noticeable gaps in clinical safety across all levels of 
health care.
OBJECTIVES: To verify that Real-Time Random Safety Analyses (AASTRE) are 
feasible and useful in a high-pressure care setting.
DESIGN: Prospective study (January-September 2022).
SETTING: University Hospital with 350 beds. Two mixed ICUs (12 and 14 beds).
INTERVENTIONS: Two safety audits per week were planned to determine the 
feasibility and usefulness of the 32 safety measures (grouped into 8 blocks).
MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: 1) Feasibility: Proportion of completed audits 
compared to scheduled audits and time spent. 2) Utility: Changes in the care 
process made as a result of implementing AASTRE.
RESULTS: A total of 390 patient-days were analyzed (179 were Non-COVID patients 
and 49 were COVID patients). In the COVID patient subgroup, age, ICU stay, SAPS 
3, and ICU mortality were significantly higher compared to the Non-COVID patient 
subgroup. Regarding feasibility, 93.8% of planned rounds were carried out with 
an average audit time of 25 ± 8 min. Overall, changes in the care process were 
made in 11.8% of the measures analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: In a high-complexity care environment, AASTRE proved to be a 
feasible and useful tool with only two interventions per week lasting less than 
30 min. Overall, AASTRE allowed unsafe situations to be turned safe in more than 
10% of the evaluations.

AIM: Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a rare cause of non-traumatic 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with significant clinical implications. This study 
compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAH from intracranial VAD 
rupture to those from other etiologies, primarily aneurysmal rupture.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study at Okayama University 
Hospital included patients with non-traumatic SAH diagnosed between 2019 and 
2023. Patients were categorized into ""VAD rupture"" and ""other etiologies"" 
groups. The main outcome was clinical presentation and symptoms. Additional 
outcomes included ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and unfavorable outcomes 
at discharge and 6 months, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6.
RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were included, with 14 in the VAD rupture group 
and 52 in the other etiologies group. The VAD rupture group was younger (median 
age 49 vs. 64 years, p = 0.003) and had a higher incidence of out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest (42.9% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.011). Preceding headache was more common 
in the VAD rupture group (78.6% vs. 11.5%, p < 0.001), with a median duration of 
36 h before presentation. ICU and in-hospital mortality was higher in the VAD 
rupture group (both 50.0% vs. 19.3%, p = 0.019). No significant differences were 
found in unfavorable neurological outcomes at hospital discharge and 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: VAD-related SAH often presents with prodromal headaches, severe 
symptoms like out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and higher ICU and in-hospital 
mortality than other SAH causes, though long-term outcomes are similar. Larger, 
prospective studies are needed to refine interventions.

Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Fixed-rate infusions of weight-based neuromuscular blocking agents 
(NMBAs) were adopted during the COVID pandemic to limit caregiver exposure 
during titrations. Although fixed-rate infusions are supported in studies of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the optimal scalar for weight-based 
NMBAs in patients with obesity remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare change in oxygenation using two 
weight-based dosing strategies for atracurium in obese patients with ARDS. 
Secondary outcomes included total atracurium dose, mortality, and intensive care 
unit (ICU) and ventilator-free days.
METHODS: Following an institutional practice update to use ideal body weight 
(IBW) for patients with obesity, we retrospectively compared adults (≥18 years) 
with ARDS and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 who received atracurium (15 
µg/kg/min) based on actual body weight (ABW) with those using IBW. The primary 
outcome was change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) 48 hours after atracurium 
initiation. Analysis-of-covariance compared change in P/F between groups after 
adjustment for confounders.
RESULTS: The IBW group (n = 123), compared with the ABW group (n = 133), had 
lower baseline P/F (85.0 [71.0, 118.3] vs 93.3 [76.0, 128.3], P = 0.025) and 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (9.7 ± 2.6 vs 10.5 ± 2.6, P = 
0.015), with greater use of steroids (96% vs 89%, P = 0.032) and prone 
positioning (72% vs 58%, P = 0.015). No difference was detected in change in P/F 
at 48 hours (adjusted least squares mean [95% confidence interval, CI]: 55.8 
[37.0, 74.5] vs 56.9 [39.6, 74.1], P = 0.90). Atracurium doses were higher in 
the ABW group (97.4 mg/h [84.4, 110.3] vs 55.4 [47.2, 65.7], P < 0.001). There 
was no difference in hospital mortality, ICU mortality, and ICU-free days or 
ventilator-free days.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In patients with obesity with ARDS receiving 
fixed-rate atracurium infusions, the change in P/F at 48 hours did not differ 
based on weight. Atracurium dosed on IBW may use less total drug without 
compromising ability to improve oxygenation. This is the first study comparing 
the dosing weight used for continuous infusion atracurium in hospitalized, 
critically ill ARDS patients with obesity. Additional studies are warranted to 
optimize dosing in obese patients.

BACKGROUND: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the favored renal 
replacement therapy in critically ill patients. Predicting clinical outcomes for 
CRRT patients is difficult due to population heterogeneity, varying clinical 
practices, and limited sample sizes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to predict survival to ICUs and hospital discharge in 
children and young adults receiving CRRT using machine learning (ML) techniques.
DERIVATION COHORT: Patients less than 25 years of age receiving CRRT for acute 
kidney injury and/or volume overload from 2015 to 2021 (80%).
VALIDATION COHORT: Internal validation occurred in a testing group of patients 
from the dataset (20%).
PREDICTION MODEL: Retrospective international multicenter study utilizing an 
80/20 training and testing cohort split, and logistic regression with L2 
regularization (LR), decision tree, random forest (RF), gradient boosting 
machine, and support vector machine with linear kernel to predict ICU and 
hospital survival. Model performance was determined by the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC) due to the imbalance in the dataset.
RESULTS: Of the 933 patients included in this study, 538 (54%) were male with a 
median age of 8.97 years and interquartile range (1.81-15.0 yr). The ICU 
mortality was 35% and hospital mortality was 37%. The RF had the best 
performance for predicting ICU mortality (AUROC, 0.791 and AUPRC, 0.878) and LR 
for hospital mortality (AUROC, 0.777 and AUPRC, 0.859). The top two predictors 
of ICU survival were Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score at CRRT 
initiation and admission diagnosis of respiratory failure.
CONCLUSIONS: These are the first ML models to predict survival at ICU and 
hospital discharge in children and young adults receiving CRRT. RF outperformed 
other models for predicting ICU mortality. Future studies should expand the 
input variables, conduct a more sophisticated feature selection, and use deep 
learning algorithms to generate more precise models.

BACKGROUND: Mrp 8/14 is abundantly secreted by activated neutrophils during 
infection and inflammation. However, its prognostic value in acute respiratory 
distress dyndrome (ARDS) induced by sepsis is poorly understood. Our aim was to 
investigate the relationship between serum Mrp 8/14 and the prognosis in 
sepsis-induced ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Serum Mrp 8/14 concentrations were analyzed in 118 ARDS patients 
induced by sepsis included in the analytical study. Patients were enrolled upon 
admission to the ICU of Nanjing Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical 
University. The baseline information and clinical outcomes were obtained. 
Patients were divided into survivor group and non-survivor group according to 
whether they died during ICU hospitalization.
RESULTS: The serum Mrp 8/14 levels were significantly increased in the 
non-survivor group compared to the survivor group (P < 0.05). Logistic 
regression analysis showed that serum Mrp 8/14, albumin and APACHE II were the 
independent factors for predicting the prognosis of sepsis-induced ARDS during 
ICU hospitalization after adjustment. Additionally, the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve for Mrp 8/14 combined with albumin was associated 
with ICU mortality and was higher than that of Mrp 8/14, albumin, APACHE II and 
Mrp 8/14 combined with APACHE II (all P < 0.05). A nomogram was constructed to 
predict ICU mortality and the c-indexes of predictive accuracy was 0.830 in the 
cohort (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The serum Mrp 8/14 upon ICU admission in septic patients may be 
useful for predicting mortality in sepsis-induced ARDS patients during ICU 
hospitalization.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic markedly increased the number of patients with 
infection-related acute respiratory distress syndrome who required 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and multiple blood transfusions. This 
study aimed to assess a potential correlation between the daily rate of 
transfused blood products and the intensive care unit (ICU) outcome of 
ECMO-supported COVID-19 patients. Methods: Data were retrieved from the 
electronic databases of three Israeli tertiary care centers. All COVID-19 
patients treated with ECMO for >3 days in these centers between July 2020 and 
November 2021 were included in the analysis. Results: The study incorporated 106 
patients [median age 49 (17-73) years]. The median numbers of ECMO days and 
daily transfused packed red blood cell (PRBC) units were 20.5 (4-240) and 0.61 
(0-2.82), respectively. In multivariate analysis, age ≥50 years was an 
independent factor for ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 4.47). In ECMO-supported 
patients for <38 days, transfusion of ≥0.85 units/day was associated with higher 
ICU mortality compared to that observed in patients transfused with <0.85 PRBC 
units/day (OR = 5.43; p < 0.004). Transfusion of ≥0.5 units/day combined with 
ECMO support of ≥38 days (OR = 17.9; p < 0.001) conferred the highest mortality 
risk. Conclusions: Three-quarters of patients <50 years old and half of patients 
≥50 years were successfully discharged from ICU. Higher daily transfusion rates 
were associated with significantly increased ICU mortality, irrespective of ECMO 
duration. Reduced blood transfusion may improve the survival of these patients. 
This approach could also contribute to the measures taken to address the 
challenges of blood shortages occurring during pandemics and other global or 
national emergencies.

Aim: This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of lactate/albumin ratio 
for ICU mortality prediction in a large cohort of patients with severe 
Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). 
Methods: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of prospectively 
collected data derived from the COVID-19 dataset for all critically ill patients 
admitted to an academic ICU. Data were used to determine the relation between 
lactate/albumin ratio and other laboratory parameters measured on the first day 
of the ICU stay and to evaluate the prognostic performance for ICU mortality 
prediction. Results: A total of 805 ICU patients were included, and the median 
age (IQR) was 67 (57-76) years, with 68% being male. ICU mortality was 48%, and 
the median lactate/albumin ratio was 0.53 (0.39-0.59). A survival analysis 
showed that patients with higher lactate/albumin ratio values had significantly 
lower survival rates (Log Rank p < 0.001). A multivariable analysis revealed 
that the lactate/albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for ICU mortality 
with a hazard ratio of 1.39 (CI: 1.27-1.52). The lactate/albumin ratio showed a 
receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC-AUC) value to 
predict ICU mortality significantly higher than that of lactate alone (0.71 vs. 
0.68, DeLong test p < 0.001). The optimal lactate/albumin ratio cut-off for 
predicting ICU mortality was 0.57, with 63% sensitivity and 73% specificity. A 
subgroup analysis revealed that the lactate/albumin ratio was significantly 
associated with mortality across different patient groups, including age and sex 
categories, and those with or without hypertension and coronary heart disease. 
Conclusions: Lactate/albumin ratio is a reliable prognostic marker in critically 
ill COVID-19 patients and could predict ICU mortality more accurately than 
lactate alone.

Background Intensive care units (ICUs) play a vital role in managing critically 
ill patients, yet data on admission patterns and outcomes in rural healthcare 
settings, particularly in Nigeria, remain limited. Understanding these patterns 
is essential for improving patient care, especially in resource-limited, rural 
settings. This study aimed to investigate the admission and outcome patterns of 
patients admitted to the ICU at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), 
located in a rural part of Edo State, Nigeria. Method This was a retrospective 
study conducted at ISTH. Data on biodata, primary admission diagnosis, duration 
of admission, and patient outcomes were collected from the ICU register for all 
patients admitted to the ICU over a five-year period, from January 1, 2019, to 
December 31, 2023, and analyzed. Results During the five-year study period, 
there were 581 ICU admissions, of which 575 (99%) were included in the study 
after excluding six (1%) due to incomplete data. Among the patients, 297 (51.7%) 
were female. The young and middle-aged group (20-59 years) accounted for 60% 
(365) of admissions. Surgical cases comprised the majority of admissions at 
57.9% (333), followed by medical cases at 25.9% (149) and obstetric/gynecologic 
cases at 16.2% (93). The most common sources of admission were general surgery 
(211, 36.7%), obstetrics (75, 13%), and neurosurgery (43, 7.5%), with the most 
frequent diagnoses being generalized peritonitis secondary to perforated viscus 
(102, 17.7%), bowel obstruction (36, 6.3%), preeclampsia/eclampsia (28,4.9%), 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) (27, 4.7%), and stroke (26, 4.5%). The overall 
mortality rate was 49.2% and was significantly associated with age, duration of 
admission, type of case, and subspecialty (p < 0.05). Conclusion The study 
highlights admission and outcome patterns that reflect the challenges faced in 
rural ICU settings. The high mortality rate highlights the need for improved 
critical care resources and targeted interventions to improve outcomes of 
critically ill patients in similar resource-limited settings.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the potential prognostic significance of 
the D-dimer-albumin ratio (DAR) in critically ill patients with sepsis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out at the Affiliated Hospital 
of Jiangsu University, involving 1123 patients diagnosed with sepsis from 
January 2015 to November 2023. The patients were categorized into four groups 
(Q1-Q4) based on their DAR levels. The primary outcomes measured were 
in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality. Survival analysis was conducted using 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. Additionally, Cox 
proportional hazards regression models were utilized to investigate the 
relationship between the DAR and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The study population had a median age of 75 years (interquartile range: 
65-84), and the median DAR was 0.15 (interquartile range: 0.08-0.32). The rates 
of hospital mortality and ICU mortality were 33.7 % and 31.9 % respectively. 
There was an observed increase in the cumulative incidence of 30-/60-day 
mortality with higher DAR levels (log-rank test, P < 0.001). After accounting 
for other variables, the results from multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
analyses demonstrated that DAR independently predicted hospital death [HR 
(95%CI): 1.419 (1.205-1.670); P < 0.001] and ICU death [HR (95%CI): 1.437 
(1.219-1.693); P < 0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: The DAR was found to be an independent predictor of all-cause 
mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in 
critically ill patients. Safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary 
outcome.
DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a 
peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent 
shock, critical care, and midodrine and including MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, 
and Cochrane library databases until September 14, 2023.
STUDY SELECTION: We included studies if they: 1) included patients with 
vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral 
midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of 
the outcomes of interest.
DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized 
data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient 
characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also 
captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention 
used, and outcome data.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included 
in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the 
pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may 
decrease ICU length of stay (LOS) and there is low certainty of effect on 
hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU 
mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very 
low certainty data for all outcomes of interest. The trial sequential 
analysis-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor 
duration and this contributed to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluations assessments of imprecision for both outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV 
vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, required 
sample sizes was not met to determine our outcomes of interest. Midodrine may 
increase risk of bradycardia. While midodrine may provide benefit for 
patient-centered outcomes, due to increased risk of adverse events, further 
large-scale studies are needed to inform and guide its routine use in the ICU.

Background/Objectives: Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU) frequently develop new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) due to 
numerous risk factors. While NOAF has been associated with increased mortality, 
it remains unclear whether it serves merely as a marker of illness severity or 
directly contributes to adverse outcome. This study aimed to determine the 
incidence and risk factors for NOAF in a homogenized population of mechanically 
ventilated patients at ICU admission, excluding well-established predisposing 
factors. Additionally, we examined the impact of NOAF on mortality in this 
context. Methods: We prospectively studied consecutive patients over a 3-year 
period to identify triggers for NOAF. Factors associated with 30-day mortality 
during the ICU stay were recorded. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory 
findings, and the severity of illness at admission were compared between 
patients who developed NOAF and those remaining in sinus rhythm. In NOAF 
patients, the course of atrial fibrillation (resolution, persistence, or 
recurrence) was evaluated during the 30-day ICU stay. Results: Of the 1330 
patients screened, 685 were eligible for analysis, with 110 (16.1%) developing 
NOAF. Septic episodes occurred more frequently in the NOAF group compared to the 
no-NOAF group (92.7% vs. 58.1%, p < 0.001). Notably, 80% of NOAF patients 
developed a septic episode concurrently with the atrial fibrillation, often 
stemming from secondary infections, and 85.3% presented with septic shock. When 
focusing on patients with at least one septic episode during the 30-day ICU 
stay, 23.4% of them developed NOAF. Additionally, patients with NOAF were older 
and had a higher prevalence of hypertension; disease severity at admission was 
not a triggering factor. Mainly sepsis, but also advanced age, and a history of 
hypertension remained independent factors associated with its occurrence. 
Sepsis, primarily, along with advanced age and a history of hypertension, was 
identified as independent factors associated with the occurrence of NOAF. 
Mortality was higher in the NOAF group compared to the control group (39 
patients (35.5%) vs. 138 patients (24%), p = 0.01). NOAF occurrence, sepsis, 
disease severity at admission, and age were associated with increased ICU 
mortality; however, NOAF was not found to be an independent predictor of ICU 
mortality in multivariate analysis. Instead, sepsis, age, and disease severity 
at admission remained independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Sinus rhythm 
was restored in 60.9% of NOAF patients within 48 h, with the improvement or 
stabilization of sepsis being crucial for rhythm restoration. Conclusions: NOAF 
is a common complication in intubated ICU patients and is independently 
associated with sepsis, advanced age, and hypertension. While NOAF is linked to 
increased ICU mortality, it is more likely a marker of disease severity than a 
direct cause of death. Sepsis improvement appears critical for restoring and 
maintaining sinus rhythm.

Background: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections are a 
serious problem in critical care. This study aims to develop an early prognostic 
score for immune paralysis, using practical and cost-effective parameters, to 
predict ICU mortality in patients with CRAB infections being treated with 
Cefiderocol. Methods: We carried out an observational pilot study on consecutive 
patients hospitalized in the ICU with ensuing septic Acinetobacter baumannii 
infections treated with Cefiderocol monotherapy or Cefiderocol including 
combinations. We investigated the predictive power of lymphocyte counts, 
lymphocyte subpopulations, serum cholinesterase levels, and reactivation of 
herpes viruses. Results: Overall, 36 of 39 patients entered in our analysis: 20 
survivors and 16 deceased. A total of 12 patients developed bacteremia, 19 
patients had HAP/VAP, and 5 patients had a soft tissue infection. Univariate 
analyses of factors associated with unfavorable outcome revealed a significant 
association for age (OR: 1.5, CI: 1.11-2.02), SAPS II (OR: 1.05, CI: 1.01-1.1), 
SOFA score (OR: 1.37, CI: 1.06-1.76), lymphocytopenia (OR: 32.5, CI: 
3.45-306.4), viral reactivation (OR: 9.75, CI: 1.72-55.4), and cholinesterase 
drop <1600 U/L (OR: 39.7, CI: 5.8-271.6). At variance, monotherapy or 
associations with Cefiderocol were not associated. In the final multivariable 
model, the only independent predictors of death were age (OR: 1.42, CI: 
0.98-2.05), lymphocytopenia (OR: 18.2, CI: 0.87-371), and cholinesterase drop to 
below 1600 U/L (OR: 9.7, CI: 0.77-123.7). Conclusions: Age, lymphocytopenia, and 
serum cholinesterase drops, which were nearly significantly associated with an 
unfavorable outcome, may help pinpoint patients with acute immune paralysis 
during sepsis. Knowledge of such an immune state may in turn directly influence 
patients' care.

OBJECTIVES: Identifying reliable biomarkers to predict mortality in critically 
ill patients is crucial for optimizing management in intensive care units 
(ICUs). Inflammatory and metabolic markers are increasingly recognized for their 
prognostic value. This study aims to evaluate the association of various 
inflammatory and metabolic markers with ICU mortality.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted from January 2023 to 
January 2024 in the City Hospital's ICU. A total of 160 critically ill patients 
were enrolled. Laboratory parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, 
red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, neutrophil count, mean 
platelet volume (MPV), monocyte count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin (PCT), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium (Ca++), and vitamin D levels, were analyzed. 
Additionally, ratios such as the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic inflammatory index (SII), and 
pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) were calculated. Plasma levels of Gla-rich 
protein (GRP) and dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) 
were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients included in the study was 60.5 ± 15.8 
years. Cardiovascular disease was present in 72 patients (45%), respiratory 
system disease in 58 (36%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 38 (24%). 
Additionally, 61 patients (38%) had diabetes, and 68 (42%) had hypertension. 
Inflammatory markers, including PLR, NLR, and PIV, were all significantly higher 
in non-survivors, while calcium and vitamin D levels were lower (p < 0.05). 
Higher WBC, RDW, neutrophil count, PLR, NLR, PIV, CRP, procalcitonin, GRP, and 
dp-ucMGP levels were positively correlated with longer hospital stays and 
increased mortality. In contrast, platelet and lymphocyte counts were negatively 
correlated with both outcomes (p < 0.05). Vitamin D levels showed an inverse 
relationship with both hospital stay and mortality, indicating that lower levels 
were associated with worse outcomes (p < 0.05). In multiple logistic regression 
analysis, elevated WBC count (OR = 1.20, p = 0.02), RDW (OR = 1.35, p = 0.01), 
neutrophil count (OR = 1.25, p = 0.01), MPV (OR = 1.20, p = 0.02), PLR (OR = 
1.30, p = 0.01), NLR (OR = 1.40, p = 0.001), PIV (OR = 1.50, p = 0.001), CRP (OR 
= 1.32, p = 0.01), procalcitonin (OR = 1.45, p = 0.001), GRP (OR = 1.40, p = 
0.001), and dp-ucMGP (OR = 1.30, p = 0.001) levels were significantly associated 
with increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory and metabolic markers, particularly NLR, PLR, PIV, 
GRP, and dp-ucMGP, are strong predictors of mortality in ICU patients. These 
markers provide valuable insights for risk stratification and early 
identification of high-risk patients, potentially guiding more targeted 
interventions to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Candidemia is associated with markedly high intensive care unit 
(ICU) mortality rates. Although the Impact of Early Enteral vs. Parenteral 
Nutrition on Mortality in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation and 
Catecholamines (NUTRIREA-2) trial indicated that early enteral nutrition (EN) 
did not reduce 28-day mortality rates among critically ill patients with shock, 
the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines 
recommend avoiding EN in cases of uncontrolled shock. Whether increased caloric 
intake from EN positively impacts clinical outcomes in patients with candidemia 
and shock remains unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from a tertiary medical center 
between January 2015 and December 2018. We enrolled patients who developed shock 
within the first 7 days following ICU admission and received a diagnosis of 
candidemia during their ICU stay. Patients with an ICU stay shorter than 48 
hours were excluded.
RESULTS: The study included 106 patients, among whom the hospital mortality rate 
was 77.4% (82 patients). The median age of the patients was 71 years, and the 
median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 29. The Cox 
regression model revealed that a higher 7-day average caloric intake through EN 
(hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83) was significantly associated with lower 
hospital mortality rates. Our findings suggest EN as the preferred feeding route 
for critically ill patients with shock.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased caloric intake through EN may be associated with lower 
hospital mortality rates in patients with candidemia and shock.

OBJECTIVES: The survival rate of people with HIV admitted to intensive care 
units (ICUs) is approaching that of people without HIV. We conducted a 
matched-cohort study of people with and without HIV admitted to ICU at a large 
hospital to compare short-term mortality, during 2000-2019.
METHODS: People with HIV were matched to people without HIV (1:2) on age, sex, 
admission year and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II 
score. Applying logistic regression models fitted using independence estimating 
equations, we describe population-averaged associations of HIV with short-term 
(in-ICU, in-hospital) mortality during a patient's first admission to ICU, and 
explore whether these varied by year.
RESULTS: A total of 177 people with HIV were matched to 354 people without HIV 
(71.2% vs. 71.2% male; median age: 47 vs. 48 years, median APACHE-II: 18 vs. 17, 
median admission year: 2013 vs. 2013). Among people with HIV, 73.4% were on 
antiretroviral therapy, 51.2% had HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL and median CD4 T-cell 
count was 132 cells/ μ L. People with HIV had higher in-ICU (24.3% vs. 15.3%) 
and in-hospital (31.6% vs. 20.1%) mortality. People with HIV had 1.69-fold 
higher odds (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.76) of in-ICU mortality and 1.86 
(1.19-2.91) higher odds of in-hospital mortality than people without HIV, 
adjusted for age, sex, year and APACHE-II. There was no evidence that these 
associations varied by year (p-interaction-in-ICU = 0.90; 
p-interaction-in-hospital = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although outcomes have improved over 
time, people with HIV continue to have higher short-term in-ICU and in-hospital 
mortality following ICU admission compared with people without HIV with similar 
characteristics.

INTRODUCTION: The vaccination drive for COVID-19 was launched in India after the 
authorization of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Covishield), an adenoviral vector vaccine, and 
BBV152 COVID-19 (Covaxin), an inactivated virus vaccine. As stated by the CDC, 
vaccine-related adverse events can happen. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
timing of the COVID vaccination and admission diagnosis and their effect on ICU 
mortality. The time from vaccination can help identify adverse events directly 
related to vaccination.  Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
across four centers in India. Patients who took the first or second dose of any 
vaccines and were admitted with non-COVID illness to the ICU were included in 
the study. Patients were categorized based on the time interval from vaccination 
as ≤42 days or >42 days. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. The secondary 
outcomes were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 
53.49 (15.89) years, and 61.14% were males. The ICU mortality was 24.57% (18.38% 
to 31.63%). Thromboembolic events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and mesenteric ischemia were seen in 7.43%, 
7.43%, and 1.14% of patients, respectively. Six patients (3.43%) developed 
neuromuscular illness. The mortality was higher in patients >66 years, followed 
by ≤35 years of age when admitted ≤42 days of vaccination (p=0.008). The 
mortality was higher in cerebrovascular disorders and was clinically significant 
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients developed thromboembolic events and neuromuscular diseases 
requiring ICU admission post-COVID vaccination. We observed a significantly 
higher mortality in the age groups >66 years and ≤35 years when admitted within 
42 days of COVID vaccination. Patients admitted with cerebrovascular diseases 
also had higher mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy combined with 
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has improved postoperative 
outcomes, yet concerns persist regarding complications and readmissions. Limited 
research has explored intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and outcomes within 
this context. The goal of this study was to analyse ICU admissions following 
VATS lobectomy within an established ERAS protocol.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy between 2018 and 2023 
were included. Patient data were obtained from our prospective institutional 
database, while ICU data were extracted from electronic patient records.
RESULTS: Of 2099 patients included, 48 (2.3%) required ICU admission. The median 
age was 70 (interquartile range: 64-76) years, with ICU patients being older and 
predominantly male (73%). Overall 30-day mortality was 1.0% with an ICU 
mortality of 31%. Multiple logistic regression revealed significant associations 
between ICU admission and male gender (P ≤ 0.001), diabetes mellitus 
(P = 0.026), heart failure (P = 0.040) and diffusing capacity for carbon 
monoxide (0.013). Median time to ICU admission was 4 days (interquartile range: 
2-10). Respiratory failure was the primary reason for ICU admission (60%). 
Severe surgical complications accounted for 8.3% of all ICU admissions.
CONCLUSIONS: In an ERAS setting, the incidence of ICU admissions following VATS 
lobectomy was 2.3%, with a mortality rate of 31%. Respiratory failure was the 
leading cause of ICU admission.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Benign tracheal stenosis (TS) is a potentially life-threatening 
condition caused by iatrogenic events resulting from endotracheal intubation and 
tracheostomy. The study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics, 
management, and long-term outcomes of patients with simple or complex 
post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) who were admitted to the intensive care 
unit (ICU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the ICU 
between June 2016 and June 2022 and diagnosed with PITS were performed until 
June 2023.
RESULTS: 76 patients (mean age 54.9 ± 17.3%, 63.2% male, 61.8% complex stenosis) 
admitted to the ICU were analysed. The diagnosis of PITS was made by fiberoptic 
bronchoscopy (FOB) in 53.9% and computed tomography (CT) in 46.1%. The most 
common location of stenosis was the upper trachea area (57.9%, n = 44). The 
median stenosis length of the TS was 1.9 cm (median 2 cm for complex stenosis, 
1 cm for simple stenosis, p < 0.001). Complex stenosis was associated with 
longer intubation time and multiple intubation history (p = 0.011, p = 0.028). 
At the same; complex stenosis was associated with prolonged and high stenosis 
percentage (p < 0.001). While dilatation and cryotherapy were sufficient for 
treatment in all patients with simple stenosis, the stent was applied to 34% 
patients with complex stenosis. Recurrence was higher in complex stenosis after 
bronchoscopic procedure (complex stenosis 95.7%, simple stenosis 17.2%). 19 
(25%) patients required surgical operation, and all of these patients had 
complex stenosis (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 33 months for simple stenosis 
and 34 months for complex stenosis. ICU length of stay (LOS) was longer in 
patients with complex stenosis. There was no statistically significant 
difference between TS classes in terms of ICU mortality (p = 0.466), 1-year 
mortality (p = 0.951), and mortality during follow-up (p = 0.608).
CONCLUSION: PITS is a challenging situation in ICU patients. In patients with a 
preliminary diagnosis of PITS, bronchoscopy should be performed without delay, 
and it should be known that interventional bronchoscopy is not only a diagnostic 
tool but an effective strategy in treatment management after the diagnosis is 
finalised. The advantage of interventional bronchoscopy is that it alleviates 
symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation in the ICU and eliminates the need for 
ICU of patients.

unit: A retrospective cohort study based on the Medical Information Mart for 
Intensive Care IV database.

Medical College Beijing China.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the epidemiological 
characteristics of very elderly patients (aged over 80 years) with cancer 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and to elucidate the association 
between Acute Physiology Score III (APS-III) and 28-day mortality.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data extracted from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients 
aged 80 years and above were assigned to three groups: non-cancer group, 
non-metastatic cancer group, and metastatic cancer group, based on their cancer 
diagnosis and its extent, Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed among these 
patient groups. Furthermore, patients were divided into a survival group and a 
non-survival group based on their 28-day survival status after ICU admission. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
detect the risk factors for 28-day mortality among these patients. Additionally, 
this investigation sought to establish a dose-response relationship by exploring 
the graded association between APS-III scores and the 28-day mortalities among 
patients diagnosed with cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 42,037 medical records were screened, from which 11,461 
elderly patients aged over 80 years were included, comprising 1020 (8.90%) with 
non-metastatic cancer, 537 (4.68%) with metastatic cancer, and 9904 (86.41%) 
without cancer. Significant differences in 28-day mortality were observed 
between both the non-metastatic and metastatic cancer groups compared to the 
non-cancer group (20.98% and 22.35% vs. 15.75%, p < 0.001). However, no 
statistically significant difference was detected in the 28-day mortality rate 
when comparing the non-metastatic cancer group directly with the metastatic 
cancer group (20.98% vs. 22.35%, p = 0.576). Univariate analysis revealed 
significant differences (p < 0.001) in age, gender, BMI, aCCI excluding cancer 
point, ventilation, presence of cancer, and status of metastatic cancer between 
the survival and non-survival groups. In the multivariate logistic regression, 
the odds ratio (OR) for ventilation was found to be 2.154 (95% CI: 1.799-2.578), 
cancer conferred an OR of 1.499 (95% CI: 1.137-1.975), metastatic cancer showed 
an OR of 1.171 (95% CI: 0.745-1.841), APS-III showed an OR of 1.038 (95% CI: 
1.034-1.042). A dose-response relationship was observed, demonstrating that when 
the APS-III score exceeded 80 points, the 28-day mortality rate surpassed 50% 
among the very elderly cancer patients in ICU.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-tenth of critically ill very elderly patients 
admitted to the ICU are diagnosed with cancer. Among ICU patients, those with 
cancer face a short-term mortality risk approximately 1.5 times higher than 
those without a cancer diagnosis. Interestingly, while our findings do not 
indicate an escalated mortality risk due to metastasis within the cancer patient 
cohort, the presence of cancer itself remains a significant factor influencing 
ICU mortality rates in this very elderly population.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, 
comparing them according to successive waves, and to identify prognostic factors 
for morbidity and mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational 
descriptive study was conducted from March 10, 2020, to October 17, 2021. All 
adult patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia presenting acute respiratory 
failure were included. COVID 19 diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR testing of 
respiratory specimens. The primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary 
endpoints were the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 437 patients were included of whom 282 (65%) 
patients were ventilated for 9 [5;20] days. Among the studied population, 38% 
were treated for one or more episodes of VAP, and 22 (5%) for bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis. ICU mortality was 26% in the first wave, then fell and stabilized 
at around 10% in subsequent waves (p = 0.02). Increased age, Charlson index, 
SOFA score and lactatemia on admission were predictive of mortality. Survival at 
90 days was 85% (95% CI 82-88) and was unaffected by the presence of VAP. 
However, the occurrence of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis increased mortality to 
36%.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed mortality in the lower range of those 
previously reported. Risk factors for mortality mainly included age and previous 
comorbidities. The prognosis of these critically ill Covid 19 patients improved 
over the four waves, underlining the likely beneficial effect of vaccination and 
dexamethasone.

The Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score was developed to overcome the 
limitations of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) when assessing individuals with 
impaired consciousness. We sought to review the evidence regarding the 
predictive validity of the GCS and FOUR score in intensive care unit (ICU) 
settings. This review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420528). 
Systematic searches of CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase were undertaken. Prospective 
observational studies were included if both GCS and FOUR score were assessed in 
adults during ICU admission and if mortality and/or validated functional outcome 
measure scores were collected. Studies were excluded if they exclusively 
investigated patients with traumatic brain injury. Screening, data extraction, 
and quality assessment using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool were 
conducted by two reviewers. Twenty studies of poor to moderate quality were 
included. Many studies only included patients with neurological illness and 
excluded sedated patients, despite high proportions of intubated patients. The 
FOUR score achieved higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for mortality prediction compared with the GCS, and the FOUR score 
achieved significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve values for predictions of ICU mortality. Both coma scales showed similar 
accuracy in predicting ""unfavorable"" functional outcome. The FOUR score appeared 
to be more responsive than the GCS in the ICU, as most patients with a GCS score 
of 3 obtained FOUR scores between 1 and 8 due to preserved brainstem function. 
The FOUR score may be superior to the GCS for predicting mortality in ICU 
settings. Further adequately powered studies with clear, reliable methods for 
assessment of index and outcome scores are required to clarify the predictive 
performance of both coma scales in ICUs. Inclusion of sedated patients may 
improve generalizability of findings in general ICU populations.

BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients face higher risks of Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and co-infections, leading to a 
possibility of high disease severity and poor outcomes. Conversely, 
immunosuppression can mitigate the excessive inflammatory response induced by 
the virus, potentially reducing disease severity. This study aims to investigate 
the prognostic differences and early inflammatory response characteristics in 
various types of immunocompromised patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), summarize their clinical 
features, and explore potential mechanisms.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on critically ill COVID-19 
patients admitted to the ICU of 59 medical centers in mainland China during the 
Omicron outbreak from November 2022 to February 2023. Patients were categorized 
into two groups based on their immunosuppression status: immunocompromised and 
immunocompetent. Immunocompromised patients were further subdivided by etiology 
into cancer patients, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, and other 
immunocompromised groups, with immunocompetent patients serving as controls. The 
mortality rates, respiratory support, complications, and early inflammatory 
cytokine dynamics upon ICU admission among different populations were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 2030 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were 
included, with 242 in the immunocompromised group and 1788 in the 
immunocompetent group. Cancer patients had a higher median age of 69 years (IQR 
59, 77), while SOT patients were generally younger and had less severe illness 
upon ICU admission, with a median APACHE II score of 12.0 (IQR 8.0, 20.0). 
Cancer patients had a twofold increased risk of death (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 
1.18-3.46, P = 0.010) compared to immunocompetent patients. SOT and cancer 
patients exhibited higher C-reactive protein and serum ferritin levels than the 
immunocompetent group in their early days of ICU admission. The CD8+ T cells 
dynamics were inversely correlated in cancer and SOT patients, with 
Interleukin-6 levels consistently lower in the SOT group compared to both 
immunocompetent and cancer patients.
CONCLUSION: Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU exhibit 
distinct clinical outcomes based on their immunosuppression status, with cancer 
patients facing the highest mortality rate due to variations in inflammatory 
responses linked to their immunosuppression mechanisms. Monitoring dynamic 
changes in inflammatory markers and immune cells, particularly CD8+ T 
lymphocytes and IL-6, may offer valuable prognostic insights for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Various social determinants of health have been established as 
significant risk factors for COVID-19 transmission, prevalence, incidence, and 
mortality. Area deprivation index (ADI, a composite score made up of 
educational, housing, and poverty markers) is an accepted multidimensional 
social determinants of health measure. Little is known about how structural 
social determinants of health before hospitalization, including ADI, may affect 
mortality related to COVID-19 in critically ill patients.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of ADI with intensive care unit (ICU) 
mortality in patients with COVID-19 and compare its predictive power with that 
of clinical factors.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of critically ill adults with 
COVID-19 in 3 hospitals within a single health system. Multivariable logistic 
regression models (adjusted for demographic and clinical variables) were used to 
examine the association of ADI with ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Data from 1784 patients hospitalized from 2020 to 2022 were analyzed. 
In multivariable models, no association was found between national ADI and ICU 
mortality. Notable factors associated with ICU mortality included treatment 
year, age, van Walraven weighted score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
body mass index.
CONCLUSION: In this study, clinical factors were more predictive of mortality 
than ADI and other social determinants of health. The influence of ADI may be 
most relevant before hospital admission. These findings could serve as a 
foundation for shaping targeted public health strategies and hospital 
interventions, enhancing care delivery, and potentially contributing to better 
outcomes in future pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Anthropometric measurements are crucial in pediatric critical care, 
but the impact of height on ICU outcomes is underexplored despite a substantial 
number of short-for-age children in ICUs. Previous studies suggest that short 
stature increases the risk of poor clinical outcomes. This study examines the 
relationship between short stature and ICU outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese nationwide 
database (the Japanese Intensive Care Patient Database; JIPAD), which included 
pediatric patients under 16 years admitted to ICUs from April 2015 to March 
2020. Height standard deviation scores (SD scores) were calculated based on age 
and sex. Short-stature patients were defined as height SD score <  - 2. The 
primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality, and the secondary outcome was the 
length of stay in ICU.
RESULTS: Out of 6,377 pediatric patients, 27.2% were classified as having short 
stature. The ICU mortality rate was significantly higher in the short-stature 
group compared to the normal-height group (3.6% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression showed that short stature was independently 
associated with increased ICU mortality (OR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.81-4.11). 
Additionally, the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model indicated that short 
stature was associated with a lower chance of ICU discharge for each additional 
day (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.90, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is a significant risk factor for increased ICU 
mortality and prolonged ICU stay in critically ill children. Height should be 
considered in risk assessments and management strategies in pediatric intensive 
care to improve outcomes.

Background: Bacterial/fungal coinfections (COIs) are associated with antibiotic 
overuse, poor outcomes such as prolonged ICU stay, and increased mortality. Our 
aim was to develop machine learning-based predictive models to identify 
respiratory bacterial or fungal coinfections upon ICU admission. Methods: We 
conducted a secondary analysis of two prospective multicenter cohort studies 
with confirmed influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and COVID-19. Multiple logistic 
regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) were used to identify factors associated 
with BFC in the overall population and in each subgroup (influenza and 
COVID-19). The performance of these models was assessed by the area under the 
ROC curve (AUC) and out-of-bag (OOB) methods for MLR and RF, respectively. 
Results: Of the 8902 patients, 41.6% had influenza and 58.4% had SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The median age was 60 years, 66% were male, and the crude ICU 
mortality was 25%. BFC was observed in 14.2% of patients. Overall, the 
predictive models showed modest performances, with an AUC of 0.68 (MLR) and OOB 
36.9% (RF). Specific models did not show improved performance. However, age, 
procalcitonin, CRP, APACHE II, SOFA, and shock were factors associated with BFC 
in most models. Conclusions: Machine learning models do not adequately predict 
the presence of co-infection in critically ill patients with pandemic virus 
infection. However, the presence of factors such as advanced age, elevated 
procalcitonin or CPR, and high severity of illness should alert clinicians to 
the need to rule out this complication on admission to the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroid has been recommended for the treatment of 
severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). 
Little is known about the use of systemic corticosteroid in patients admitted to 
intensive care units (ICU) since most of previous trials excluded these 
critically ill patients.
METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study based on the Medical Information 
Mart in Intensive Care-IV database. Patients with AECOPD in ICUs were included. 
Patients in the exposure group should be intravenously administrated with 
methylprednisolone or treated with oral prednisone within 24 h after ICU 
admission. The propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were used to 
adjust for covariates. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary 
outcomes included ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the duration of ICU 
stay, and mechanical ventilation. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were 
performed according to age, sex, type of corticosteroid, type of ICU admission, 
type of mechanical ventilation, and co-morbidities/complications.
RESULTS: The entire cohort and the matched cohort included 763 and 412 patients, 
respectively. In the matched cohort, the use of systemic corticosteroid had no 
impact on 28-day mortality (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.61-1.64, P = 1.000). The results 
kept consistent in all subgroups. Additionally, systemic corticosteroid showed 
no benefits on ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, the length of ICU stay, and 
the duration of mechanical ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support routine use of systemic 
corticosteroid in patients with AECOPD admitted to ICUs.

OBJECTIVE: Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant threat, 
contributing to worse outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Thus, 
understanding the complex relationship between sepsis and renal dysfunction in 
ICU patients is crucial. We aimed to investigate the factors that may predispose 
to the development and the clinical consequences of new-onset AKI in septic 
medical ICU patients in this study.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort was conducted between December 2019 and April 
2023 in the tertiary medical ICU of Gazi University Hospital, Ankara, Turkiye. 
Participants included septic medical ICU patients aged ≥18 without AKI on ICU 
admission. Data included demographics, comorbidities, disease severity and 
prognostic scoring, ICU admission, and ICU follow-up data. Statistical analyses, 
including logistic regression, were performed to identify independent risk 
factors for new-onset AKI development and ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Patients with new-onset AKI (36% incidence) had higher APACHE-II (21 
[16-27] vs. 16 [12-18]) and SOFA (6 [3-9] vs. 3 [2-5]) scores and lower GCS (10 
[6-15] vs. 14 [10-15]) on ICU admission (p<0.01 for all results). Independent 
risk factors for both new AKI development and ICU mortality included invasive 
mechanical ventilation (IMV) (OR (95% CI): 5.02 [1.59-15] for AKI and OR (95% 
CI): 13.2 [3-58.8] for ICU mortality, p<0.01), new-onset shock (OR (95% CI): 
3.98 [1.42-11.1] for AKI, OR (95% CI): 14.5 [4.4-43.5] for mortality, p<0.01), 
and higher APACHE-II score (OR (95% CI): 1.08 [1.01-1.16]), for AKI, p=0.05 and 
(OR (95% CI): 1.04 [1.01-1.08], for mortality, p=0.01). AKI was more frequent in 
patients whose source of infection was the respiratory system (45% vs. 29%, 
p=0.01) and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) (17% vs. 8%, p=0.03) 
than those who did not. New AKI development was associated with longer ICU stay 
(9 [5-18] vs. 5 [3-10] days, p<0.01) and was independently associated with ICU 
mortality (OR (95% CI): 28.6 [6.6-125], p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study reveals new-onset AKI incidence of 36% in septic medical 
ICU patients. Additionally, it underlines the potential impact of infection 
sources on new AKI development. New-onset shock, IMV, and disease severity were 
independently associated with both new-onset AKI and ICU mortality in this 
population.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor produced by endothelial cells 
and cleared from circulating blood mainly in the pulmonary vasculature. In a 
healthy pulmonary circulation, the rate of local production of ET-1 is less than 
its rate of clearance. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the 
abnormal pulmonary circulatory handling of ET-1 relates to poor clinical 
outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To this end, central venous and systemic 
arterial ET-1 plasma levels were simultaneously measured on Days 1 and 3 
following ICU admission in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS 
(COVID-19 ARDS, N = 18). Central venous and systemic arterial ET-1 plasma levels 
were also measured in two distinct SARS-CoV-2-negative mechanically ventilated 
critically ill patient groups, matched for age, sex, and critical illness 
severity, with ARDS (non-COVID-19 ARDS, N = 14) or without ARDS (non-COVID-19 
non-ARDS, N = 20). Upon ICU admission, COVID-19-induced ARDS patients had higher 
systemic arterial and central venous ET-1 levels compared to the non-COVID-19 
ARDS and non-COVID-19 non-ARDS patients (p < 0.05), yet a normal systemic 
arterial:central venous (A:V) ET-1 ratio [0.63 (0.49-1.02)], suggesting that 
pulmonary ET-1 clearance is intact in these patients. On the other hand, the 
non-COVID-19 ARDS patients demonstrated abnormal ET-1 handling [A:V ET-1 ratio 
1.06 (0.93-1.20)], while the non-COVID-19 non-ARDS group showed normal ET-1 
handling [0.79 (0.52-1.11)]. On Day 3, the A:V ratio in all three groups was <1. 
When the COVID-19 ARDS patients were divided based on 28-day ICU mortality, 
while their systemic arterial and central venous levels did not differ, the A:V 
ET-1 ratio was statistically significantly higher upon ICU admission in the 
non-survivors [0.95 (0.78-1.34)] compared to the survivors [0.57 (0.48-0.92), p 
= 0.027]. Our results highlight the potential importance of ET-1 as both a 
biomarker and a therapeutic target in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The 
elevated A:V ET-1 ratio in non-survivors suggests that the early disruption of 
pulmonary ET-1 handling may be a key marker of poor prognosis.

PURPOSES: Since 2016, the World Health Organization has recommended universal 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (PLHIV). This recommendation may have influenced the characteristics and 
outcomes of PLHIV admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This study aims to 
identify changes in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of PLHIV 
admitted to the ICU, and their short- and medium-term outcomes before and after 
the implementation of universal ART (periods 2006-2015 and 2016-2019).
METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single-center study included all 
adult PLHIV admitted to the ICU of a University Hospital in Barcelona from 2006 
to 2019.
RESULTS: The study included 502 admissions involving 428 patients, predominantly 
men (75%) with a median (P25-P75) age of 47.5 years (39.7-53.9). Ninety-one 
percent were diagnosed with HIV before admission, with 82% under ART and 60% 
admitted from the emergency department. In 2016-2019, there were more patients 
on ART pre-admission, reduced needs for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) 
and fewer in-ICU complications. ICU mortality was also lower (14% vs 7%). 
Predictors of in-ICU mortality included acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
defining event (ADE)-related admissions, ICU complications, higher SOFA scores, 
IMV and renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement. ART use during ICU 
admission was protective. Higher SOFA scores, admission from hospital wards, and 
more comorbidities predicted one-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The in-ICU mortality of critically ill PLHIV has decreased in 
recent years, likely due to changes in patient characteristics. Pre- and ICU 
admission features remain the primary predictors of short- and medium-term 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, numerous studies on potential factors 
contributing to ventilation-induced lung injury have been carried out. 
Mechanical power has been pointed out as the parameter that encloses all 
ventilation-induced lung injury-contributing factors. However, studies conducted 
to date provide data regarding mechanical power during the early hours of 
mechanical ventilation that may not accurately reflect the impact of power 
throughout the period of mechanical ventilatory support on intensive care unit 
mortality.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study conducted at a single center in 
Spain. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit, > o = 18 years of age, and 
ventilated for over 24 h were included. We extracted the mechanical power values 
throughout the entire mechanical ventilation in controlled modes period from the 
clinical information system every 2 min. First, we calculate the cutoff-point 
for mechanical power beyond which there was a greater change in the probability 
of death. After, the sum of time values above the safe cut-off point was 
calculated to obtain the value in hours. We analyzed if the number of hours the 
patient was under ventilation with a mechanical power above the safe threshold 
was associated with intensive care unit mortality, invasive mechanical 
ventilation days, and intensive care unit length of stay. We repeated the 
analysis in different subgroups based on the degree of hypoxemia and in patients 
with SARS CoV-2 pneumonia.
RESULTS: The cut-off point of mechanical power at with there is a higher 
increase in intensive care unit mortality was 18 J/min. The greater the number 
of hours patients were under mechanical power > 18 J/min the higher the 
intensive care unit mortality in all the study population, in patients with SARS 
CoV-2 pneumonia and in mild to moderate hypoxemic respiratory failure. The risk 
of death in the intensive care unit increases 0.1% for each hour with mechanical 
power exceeding 18 J/min. The number of hours with mechanical power > 18 J/min 
also affected the days of invasive mechanical ventilation and intensive care 
unit length of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of hours with mechanical power > 18 J/min is associated 
with mortality in the intensive care unit in critically ill patients. Continuous 
monitoring of mechanical power in controlled modes using an automated clinical 
information system could alert the clinician to this risk.

PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data from sub-Saharan Africa describing Severe 
Community Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP), a condition with significant morbidity and 
mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, observational 
study of consecutive patients with SCAP admitted to the ICU at Charlotte Maxeke 
Johannesburg Academic Hospital, in South Africa between 1 July 2007 and 31 May 
2019. Pneumonia was categorised as community-acquired if there had been no 
hospitalization in the preceding 2 weeks.
RESULTS: We identified 931 patients, (median age 37 [IQR 30-48] years), with the 
predominant co-morbidity being HIV co-infection (77.1 %). The median CURB-65 and 
APACHE II scores were 3 (IQR 2-3) and 18 (IQR 14-23) respectively, and most 
patients had multilobar consolidation on chest X-ray. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
was the most common aetiology, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The latter, 
and Pneumocystis jirovecii were more common amongst survivors and non-survivors, 
respectively. ICU mortality was 50.1 % and 85 % of patients required 
ventilation, mostly invasive mechanical ventilation. Ventilated patients and 
those requiring inotropic support and/or dialysis were more likely to die.
CONCLUSION: We have described a cohort of patients with SCAP, with a 
comprehensive overview of all putative microbiological causes, which to our 
knowledge, is the largest reported in the literature.

The Brazilian Amazon is a vast area with limited health care resources. To 
assess the epidemiology of critically ill acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in 
this area, a prospective cohort study of 1029 adult patients of the three 
intensive care units (ICUs) of Rio Branco city, the capital of Acre state, were 
evaluated from February 2014 to February 2016. The incidence of AKI was 53.3%. 
Risk factors for AKI included higher age, nonsurgical patients, admission to the 
ICU from the ward, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II scores at ICU admission, and positive fluid balance > 1500 ml/24 
hours in the days before AKI development in the ICU, with aOR of 1.3 (95% CI 
1.03-1.23), 1.47 (95% CI 1.07-2.03), 1.96 (95% CI 1.40-2.74), 1.05 (95% CI 
1.03-1.08) for each unit increase, and 1.62 (95% CI 1.16-2.26), respectively. 
AKI was associated with higher ICU mortality (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29-3.18). AKI 
mortality was independently associated with higher age, nonsurgical patients, 
sepsis at ICU admission, presence of shock or use of vasoactive drugs, 
mechanical ventilation and mean positive fluid balance in the ICU > 1500 ml/24 
hours, both during ICU follow-up, with aOR 1.27 (95% CI 1.14-1.43) for each 
10-year increase, 1.64 (95% CI 1.07-2.52), 2.35 (95% CI 1.14-4.83), 1.88 (95% CI 
1.03-3.44), 6.73 (95% CI 4.08-11.09), 2.31 (95% CI 1.52-3.53), respectively. 
Adjusted hazard ratios for AKI mortality 30 and 31-180 days after ICU discharge 
were 3.13 (95% CI 1.84-5.31) and 1.69 (95% CI 0.99-2.90), respectively. AKI 
incidence was strikingly high among critically ill patients in the Brazilian 
Amazon. The AKI etiology, risk factors and outcomes were similar to those 
described in high-income countries, but mortality rates were higher.

BACKGROUND: Heart rate is crucial for patients with septic shock, but there are 
few studies on the scope of heart rate. Therefore, we studied the relationship 
between different heart rates and mortality of critically ill patients with 
septic shock, and explored the optimal heart rate range, in order to provide new 
insights for clinical treatment of septic shock.
METHODS: This retrospective study utilized time-series heart rate data from the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) IV database. Patients with 
septic shock were identified as the Sepsis 3.0 criteria and received vasopressor 
therapy in the first 24 h since ICU admission. We calculated the time-weighted 
average heart rate (TWA-HR) based on the time-series data. The restricted cubic 
spline (RCS) analysis was employed to investigate the nonlinear relationship 
between heart rate and 28-day mortality, aiming to explore the optimal heart 
rate control target for septic patients and using this target as the exposure 
factor. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcome were 
ICU and in-hospital mortality. For the original cohort, we applied the log-rank 
test to infer the relationship between heart rate and mortality. To control for 
bias introduced by confounders, we utilized propensity score matching (PSM) to 
reduce imbalances between normal TWA-HR and high TWA-HR groups, and we 
established a series of models [the multivariable Cox model, matching weight 
(MW)-adjusted Cox model, multivariable logistic regression, MW-adjusted logistic 
regression, and doubly robust model] as sensitivity analyses and subgroup 
analyses to demonstrate the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 13492 patients were included in our study. The RCS analysis 
based on Cox and logistic regression showed increased risk of mortality 
(P < 0.001, non-linear P < 0.001) when TWA-HR > 85 beats per minute (bpm). The 
log-rank test revealed in terms of the 28-day mortality, the hazard ratio (HR) 
(95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.92 (1.78-2.06, P < 0.001) for patients with 
high TWA-HR compared to normal TWA-HR group. Similarly, for the ICU mortality, 
the HR (95% CI) was 1.64 (1.52-1.78, P < 0.001), and for the in-hospital 
mortality, the HR (95% CI) was 1.61 (1.48-1.76, P < 0.001). Collectively, the 
sensitivity analysis consistently demonstrated higher 28-day mortality, ICU 
mortality, and in-hospital mortality in patients with TWA-HR > 85 bpm.
CONCLUSION: Patients with septic shock whose heart rate was controlled no more 
than 85 bpm during ICU stay received survival benefit in terms of 28-day, ICU 
and in-hospital mortality. .

PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has revived the debate on the 
optimal tidal volume during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some 
experts recommend 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for all patients, while 
others suggest 7-9 mL/kg PBW for those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. We 
investigated whether a tidal volume ≥ 7 ml/kg PBW may be safe in COVID-19 
patients, particularly those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis of a multicenter study compares 
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality among 600 patients ventilated with <7 
or ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW. Compliance was categorized as <40, 40-50, or > 50 mL/cmH2O.
RESULTS: 346 patients were ventilated with <7 (6.2 ± 0.5) mL/kg PBW and 254 with 
≥7 (7.9 ± 0.9) mL/kg PBW. ICU mortality was 33 % and 29 % in the two groups 
(p = 0.272). At multivariable regression analysis, tidal volume ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW 
was associated with lower ICU mortality in the overall population (odds ratio: 
0.62 [95 %-confidence interval: 0.40-0.95]) and in each compliance category.
CONCLUSIONS: A tidal volume ≥ 7 (up to 9) mL/kg PBW was associated with lower 
ICU mortality in these COVID-19 patients, including those with compliance 
<40 mL/cmH2O. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the 
retrospective study design.

Background and objective Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare issues in 
surgical patients admitted to the surgery ward or ICU, affecting millions of 
people worldwide annually, with a mortality rate between one in three and one in 
six of those affected. The incidence and mortality of sepsis vary greatly by 
region, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, South Asia, 
East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Of all sepsis cases in 2017, 33.1 million people 
suffered from ill health due to underlying infectious diseases, and 15.8 million 
suffered from underlying injuries or non-communicable diseases.  Methods This 
prospective observational study was conducted at the Jimma University Medical 
Centre (JUMC) in Jimma town in southwest Ethiopia, from April 2023 to October 
2023. All surgical patients aged ≥15 years who presented with or developed 
septic shock at the Jimma University Medical Centre were included. Results The 
study involved a total of 61 patients. The median age of the patients was 45 
years [interquartile range (IQR): 40-60 years], and 77% (n=47) of the patients 
were male. The most frequent source of infection in this study was 
community-acquired infection (83.3%, n=49). The most common focus of sepsis was 
the intra-abdominal infection of the digestive system (82%, n=50). Lactate level 
testing and blood cultures before administering antibiotics were not done for 
all septic shock patients. Source control surgery was performed in 52.5% (n=32) 
of patients after developing septic shock, and 84.4% (n=27) of surgeries were 
performed within 24 hours. The 30-day mortality rate was 80.3%, with an ICU 
mortality rate of 78.94%. The median length of stay in the ICU was three days 
(IQR: 1-5 days), and the median length of hospital stay was six days (IQR: 2-15 
days). Conclusions The mortality rate in our cohort was higher compared to that 
in studies from high-income and low-income countries. There was poor adherence 
and compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (the one-hour bundle) 
guidelines. The length of stay in hospitals and ICUs was lower compared to 
studies from high-income countries due to the high early mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the correlation between hyperglycemia at 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the incidence of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in patients after cardiac surgery.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, in which clinical data were 
extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 
database. Adults (≥18 years) in the database who were admitted to the 
cardiovascular intensive care unit after cardiac surgery were enrolled. The 
primary outcome was the incidence of AKI within 7 days following ICU admission. 
Secondary outcomes included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, ICU length of 
stay, and the 28-day and 90-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis 
was used to assess the association between ICU-admission hyperglycemia and AKI 
incidence within 7 days of ICU admission. Different adjustment strategies were 
used to adjust for potential confounders. Patients were divided into three 
groups according to their highest blood glucose levels recorded within 24 h of 
ICU admission: no hyperglycemia (<140 mg/dL), mild hyperglycemia (140-200 
mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (≥200 mg/dL).
RESULTS: Of the 6905 included patients, 2201 (31.9%) were female, and the median 
(IQR) age was 68.2 (60.1-75.9) years. In all, 1836 (26.6%) patients had severe 
hyperglycemia. The incidence of AKI within 7 days of ICU admission, ICU 
mortality, and hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with 
severe admission hyperglycemia than those with mild hyperglycemia or no 
hyperglycemia (80.3% vs. 73.6% and 61.2%, respectively; 2.8% vs. 0.9% and 1.9%, 
respectively; and 3.4% vs. 1.2% and 2.5%, respectively; all P <0.001). Severe 
hyperglycemia was a risk factor for 7-day AKI (Model 1: hazard ratio 
[HR]=1.4809, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3126 to 1.6707; Model 2: HR=1.1639, 
95% CI: 1.0176 to 1.3313; Model 3: HR=1.2014, 95% CI: 1.0490 to 1.3760; all P 
<0.050). Patients with normal glucose levels (glucose levels <140 mg/dL) had a 
higher 28-day mortality rate than those with severe hyperglycemia (glucose 
levels ≥200 mg/dL) (4.0% vs. 3.8%, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In post-cardiac surgery patients, severe hyperglycemia within 24 h 
of ICU admission increases the risk of 7-day AKI, ICU mortality, and hospital 
mortality. Clinicians should be extra cautious regarding AKI among patients with 
hyperglycemia at ICU admission after cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia is now more common in intensive care unit (ICU) 
patients and is strongly associated with poor prognosis. Whether this 
association exists in critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) is 
unknown. This study investigated the prognostic relationship of stress 
hyperglycemia on critically ill patients with CS.
METHODS: We included 393 critically ill patients with CS from the MIMIC IV 
database in this study and categorized the patients into four groups based on 
quartiles of Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). We assessed the correlation 
between SHR and mortality using restricted cubic spline analysis and Cox 
proportional hazards models. The primary outcomes observed were ICU mortality 
and hospitalization mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age of the entire study population was 68 years, of which 30% 
were male (118 cases). There was no significant difference between the four 
groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, and vital signs (P>0.05). There was an 
increasing trend in the levels of lactate (lac), white blood cell count (WBC), 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), glucose and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) from 
group Q1 to group Q2, with the greatest change in patients in group Q4 (P<0.05) 
and the patients in group Q4 had the highest use of mechanical ventilation, the 
longest duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay. After 
adjusting for confounders, SHR was found to be strongly associated with patient 
ICU mortality, showing a U-shaped relationship.
CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients with CS, stress hyperglycemia assessed by 
SHR was significantly associated with patient ICU mortality.

AIMS: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a life-threatening disease burdened by a 
mortality up to 50%. The epidemiology has changed with non-ischaemic aetiologies 
being predominant, although data were mainly derived from patients admitted to 
dedicated acute cardiac care. We report the epidemiology and outcome of patients 
with CS admitted to general intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective multicentric epidemiological study including 
314 general ICU adhering to the GiViTI nationwide registry from 2011 to 2018, 
excluding cardiac arrest. The primary endpoint of the study was mortality. The 
association between clinical factors and mortality was evaluated using a 
logistic regression model. The odds ratios (ORs) of the covariates quantify 
their association with mortality during hospitalization. A total of 11 052 
patients admitted to general ICU {incidence 2.17%; median age 72 [interquartile 
range (66-81)], 38.7% were women} with CS were included. Forty-seven per cent of 
patients had more than three organ insufficiency at the time of admission. The 
most common CS aetiologies were left heart failure (LHF, 5247-47.5%); acute 
myocardial infarction (3612-32.6%); right heart failure (RHF, 515-4.6%); and 
biventricular failure (532-4.8%). A total of 85.5% were mechanically ventilated 
during the ICU hospitalization. The overall ICU mortality was 44.8%, increasing 
to 53.4% during the hospitalization in the index hospital and to 54.3% at the 
latest hospital. Right heart failure-cardiogenic shock patients exhibited the 
highest mortality risk [OR: 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.94-1.50); P < 
0.001], followed by biventricular CS [OR 1.04, 95% CI (0.82-1.32)]. Respiratory 
failure [OR 1.13 (95% CI 1.08-1.19)], coagulation disorder [1.17 (95% CI 
1.1-1.24)], renal dysfunction [OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.50-1.61)], and neurological 
alteration [OR 1.45 (95% CI 1.39-1.50)] were associated with worsen outcome 
along with severe hypotension [systolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg-OR 2.35, 95% CI 
(2.06-2.67)], increasing age [OR 2.21 95% CI (2.01-2.42)], and longer ICU stay 
prior to admission (two-fold increase for each 4.7 days).
CONCLUSION: In the general ICU, the aetiology of CS, excluding cardiac arrest, 
remains characterized mostly by LHF with RHF-CS burdened by higher mortality. 
Multiorgan failure at admission and longer hospital stay before ICU admission 
predispose to worsen outcome.

This study delves into the correlation between the triglyceride glucose-body 
mass index (TyG-BMI) index upon hospital admission and clinical outcomes among 
this patient population. We investigated the association between TyG-BMI at 
hospital admission and clinical outcomes in this patient group, and analyzed 
data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, 
identifying acute pancreatitis (AP) patients admitted to ICUs and stratifying 
them by TyG-BMI quartiles. We assessed the relationship between TyG-BMI and 
mortality (both in-hospital and ICU) using Cox proportional hazards regression 
and restricted cubic splines. The cohort included 419 patients, average age 
56.34 ± 16.62 years, with a majority being male (61.58%). Hospital and ICU 
mortality rates were 11.93% and 7.16%, respectively. Higher TyG-BMI was 
positively correlated with increased all-cause mortality. Patients in the 
highest TyG-BMI quartile had significantly greater risks of in-hospital and ICU 
mortality. An S-shaped curve in the spline analysis indicated a threshold effect 
at a TyG-BMI of 243 for increased in-hospital mortality risk. TyG-BMI is a 
reliable predictor of both in-hospital and ICU mortality in severely ill AP 
patients, suggesting its utility in enhancing risk assessment and guiding 
clinical interventions for this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Status Epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency with high 
mortality rate that often requires admission in Intensive Care Units (ICU). 
Several factors of worse outcome have been identified in prior studies. The aim 
of our study was to determine the mortality in ICU and in the ward in patients 
with SE admitted to an ICU and to identify risk factors of mortality.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with SE treated in the 
ICU of a tertiary medical center between 2015 and 2020. The primary outcome 
measure was mortality in the ICU (ICU death) or in the ward after ICU discharge 
(post-ICU death).
RESULTS: 252 patients were included, with a mean age of 63 (±16) years and 127 
males (50 %). 58 died in the ICU, 27 died in the ward. Overall mortality was 
associated with a higher burden of comorbidities (OR:1.28, p < 0.001), the use 
of vasopressors (OR: 5.65, p < 0.001) and a higher burden of ICU complications 
(OR: 1.32, p = 0.002). Mortality rate was higher in more severe SE episodes 
(nonconvulsive, acute symptomatic and refractoriness. In-ICU mortality was 
associated with the use of vasopressors (OR: 7.92, p<0.001) and mechanical 
ventilation (OR: 3.13, p = 0.031), the length of in-ICU stay (OR: 0.91, p = 
0.005) and a higher burden of ICU complications (OR: 1.37, p = 0.001). Compared 
to post-ICU deaths, ICU deaths also had higher Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score on ICU admission (p<0.001). Post-ICU mortality was 
associated with a higher burden of comorbidities (OR: 1.34, p<0.001), a higher 
burden of complications after ICU-discharge (OR: 1.33, p = 0.01), and more often 
refractory SE episode (OR: 2.63, p = 0.01). Compared to survivors, post-ICU 
deaths experienced mostly infectious and respiratory complications, after 
ICU-discharge.
CONCLUSION: Death was more frequent in more severe SE episodes: non convulsive 
semiology, acute etiology, and refractoriness. In-ICU, post-ICU and all-cause 
mortality in patients with SE admitted to an ICU are all associated with a 
higher burden of comorbidities, which are non-modifiable prognostic factors, but 
also with a higher burden of complications, some of which are preventable, such 
as respiratory infections.

BACKGROUND: Age is a significant consideration for intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. However, the reported associations between increasing age and 
mortality vary across studies, and data in the local context of Malaysia are 
lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine the impact of 
increasing age on ICU mortality.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of ICU patients was conducted between 
January 2020 and November 2023 at a university hospital in Malaysia. Patients 
were classified into two categories according to age (years) and into four 
groups according to National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings 
(MeSH): young adult (19-24), adult (25-44), middle age (45-64), and elderly 
(≥65). The Cochran-Armitage test for trend and Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of increasing age on 
ICU mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,661 patients was analyzed. The Cochran-Armitage test 
showed a significant positive association between ICU mortality rate and age 
group (Z=-4.86, P<0.01) or MeSH category (Z=-5.36, P<0.01). After adjusting for 
other confounders, the strongest predictor for ICU mortality in the Cox 
proportional hazards regression analyses was age, with the elderly age group 
having the highest adjusted hazard ratio of 4.777 (95% CI, 1.128-20.231; 
P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Age had a significant impact on ICU mortality in our cohort of 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is a relatively common complication in patients 
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, few studies have 
reported the factors associated with hypothermia.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in five intensive care units 
(ICUs) to evaluate the incidence of hypothermia and the predictive factors for 
developing hypothermia during CRRT, with hypothermia defined as a time-weighted 
average temperature <36 °C.
RESULTS: From January 2020 to December 2021, 300 patients were enrolled. 
Hypothermia developed in 23.7% of them within the first 24 hours after CRRT 
initiation. Compared to non-hypothermic patients, hypothermic patients were 
older and had lower body weight, more frequent acidemia, and higher ICU and 
30-day mortality rates. In the multivariate analysis, age >70 years (odds ratio 
[OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.38-4.98; P=0.004), higher positive fluid balance on the 
day before CRRT (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P=0.02), and CRRT dose (OR, 1.003; 
95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P=0.04) were significantly associated with hypothermia. 
Conversely, a higher body weight was independently associated with mitigated 
risk of hypothermia (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97; P=0.01). Moreover, a higher 
coefficient of variance of temperature was associated with greater ICU mortality 
(OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.78; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia during CRRT is a relatively common occurrence, and 
factors associated with hypothermia onset in the first 24 hours include older 
age, lower body weight, higher positive fluid balance on the day before CRRT, 
and higher CRRT dose. Greater temperature variability was associated with 
increased ICU mortality.

INTRODUCTION: The proportion of very elderly patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) is expected to rise. Furthermore, patients are likely more prone to suffer 
a cardiac arrest (CA) event within the ICU. The occurrence of intensive care 
unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) is associated with high mortality. To date, the 
incidence of ICU-CA and its clinical impact on outcome in the very old (≥ 90 
years) patients treated is unknown.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive critically ill patients ≥ 90 
years admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care university hospital in Hamburg 
(Germany). All patients suffering ICU-CA were included and CA characteristics 
and functional outcome was assessed. Clinical course and outcome were assessed 
and compared between the subgroups of patients with and without ICU-CA.
RESULTS: 1,108 critically ill patients aged ≥ 90 years were admitted during the 
study period. The median age was 92.3 (91.0-94.2) years and 67% (n = 747) were 
female. 2% (n = 25) of this cohort suffered ICU-CA after a median duration 0.5 
(0.2-3.2) days of ICU admission. The presumed cause of ICU-CA was cardiac in 64% 
(n = 16). The median resuscitation time was 10 (2-15) minutes and the initial 
rhythm was shockable in 20% (n = 5). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 
could be achieved in 68% (n = 17). The cause of ICU admission was primarily 
medical in the total cohort (ICU-CA: 48% vs. No ICU-CA: 34%, p = 0.13), surgical 
- planned (ICU-CA: 32% vs. No ICU-CA: 37%, p = 0.61) and surgical - 
unplanned/emergency (ICU-CA: 43% vs. No ICU-CA: 28%, p = 0.34). The median 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1-3) points for patients with ICU-CA and 
1 (0-2) for patients without ICU-CA (p = 0.54). Patients with ICU-CA had a 
higher disease severity according to SAPS II (ICU-CA: 54 vs. No ICU-CA: 36 
points, p < 0.001). Patients with ICU-CA had a higher rate of mechanically 
ventilation (ICU-CA: 64% vs. No ICU-CA: 34%, p < 0.01) and required vasopressor 
therapy more often (ICU-CA: 88% vs. No ICU-CA: 41%, p < 0.001). The ICU and 
in-hospital mortality was 88% (n = 22) and 100% (n = 25) in patients with ICU-CA 
compared to 17% (n = 179) and 28% (n = 306) in patients without ICU-CA. The 
mortality rate for patients with ICU-CA was observed to be 88% (n = 22) in the 
ICU and 100% (n = 25) in-hospital. In contrast, patients without ICU-CA had an 
in-ICU mortality rate of 17% (n = 179) and an in-hospital mortality rate of 28% 
(n = 306) (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of ICU-CA in very elderly patients is rare but 
associated with high mortality. Providing CPR in this cohort did not lead to 
long-term survival at our centre. Very elderly patients admitted to the ICU 
likely benefit from supportive care only and should probably not be resuscitated 
due to poor chance of survival and ethical considerations. Providing 
personalized assurances that care will remain appropriate and in accordance with 
the patient's and family's wishes can optimise compassionate care while avoiding 
futile life-sustaining interventions.

BACKGROUND: Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a dependable indicator of insulin 
resistance, has been identified as a valid marker regarding multiple 
cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the correlation of TyG index with acute 
myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) remains 
uncertain. Our study aims for elucidating this relationship by comprehensively 
analyzing two large-scale cohorts.
METHODS: Utilizing records from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the 
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, the link between TyG and the 
incidence and prognosis of AMICS was assessed multicentrally and retrospectively 
by logistic and correlation models, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS). 
Propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW), and overlap weighting (OW) were employed to balance the potential 
confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed according to potential modifiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 5208 AMI patients, consisting of 375 developing CS were 
finally included. The TyG index exhibited an apparently higher level in AMI 
populations developing CS than in those who did not experienced CS [9.2 
(8.8-9.7) vs. 9.0 (8.5-9.5)], with a moderate discrimination ability to 
recognize AMICS from the general AMI (AUC: 0.604). Logistic analyses showed that 
the TyG index was significantly correlated with in-hospital and ICU mortality. 
RCS analysis demonstrated a linear link between elevated TyG and increased risks 
regarding in-hospital and ICU mortality in the AMICS population. An increased 
mortality risk remains evident in PSM-, OW- and IPTW-adjusted populations with 
higher TyG index who have undergone CS. Correlation analyses demonstrated an 
apparent link between TyG index and APS score. Subgroup analyses presented a 
stable link between elevated TyG and mortality particularly in older age, 
females, those who are overweight or hypertensive, as well as those without 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated TyG index was related to the incidence of CS following AMI 
and higher mortality risks in the population with AMICS. Our findings pointed a 
previously undisclosed role of TyG index in regard to AMICS that still requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility, illness severity, and hospital course are widely 
acknowledged. The effects of sex on outcomes experienced by patients with severe 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of sex on ICU mortality in patients with 
COVID-19 METHODS: This retrospective analysis of an international multi-center 
prospective observational database included adults admitted to ICU for treatment 
of acute COVID-19 between 1st January 2020 and 30th June 2022. The primary 
outcome was ICU mortality. Multivariable Cox regression was used to ascertain 
the hazard of death (Hazard Ratio=HR) adjusted for pre-selected covariates. The 
secondary outcome was sex differences in complications of COVID-19 during 
hospital stay.
RESULTS: Overall, 10,259 patients (3,314 females, 6,945 males) were included 
with a median age of 60 (interquartile range [IQR]=49-68) and 59 (IQR=49-67) 
years, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between sexes. More 
females were non-smokers (65% vs. 44 %, p < 0.01) and obese (39% vs. 30 %, p < 
0.01), compared to males. Also, males received greater ICU intervention 
(mechanical ventilation, prone ventilation, vasopressors, and tracheostomy) than 
females. Males had a greater hazard of death (compared to females, HR=1.14; 95 % 
CI=1.02-1.26). Adjustment for complications during hospital stay did not alter 
the hazard of death (HR=1.16; 95 % CI=1.05-1.28). Males had a significantly 
elevated hazard of death among patients who received ECMO (HR=1.24; 95 % 
CI=1.01-1.53). Male sex was associated with cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 
[aOR]=1.37; 95 % CI=1.16-1.62) and PE (aOR=1.28; 95 % CI=1.06-1.55).
CONCLUSION: Among patients admitted to ICU for severe COVID-19, males 
experienced higher severity of illness and more frequent intervention than 
females. Ultimately, the hazard of death was moderately elevated in males 
compared to females despite greater PE and cardiac arrest.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and outcome in 
Kuwait are unknown. Moreover, non-Kuwaitis, who represent 66% of the population, 
have lower income, and their access to public health services is restricted 
compared with Kuwaitis who have free full access.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective multicenter cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients with AKI in 7 public hospitals from 
January 1 to December 31, 2021.
EXPOSURE: AKI identified using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes serum 
creatinine-based criteria.
OUTCOMES: For hospitalized patients with AKI, the outcomes included 30-day 
outcomes of mortality, need for dialysis, kidney recovery rates, and differences 
in outcomes between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: A backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis 
was performed to assess possible independent risk factors for the outcomes.
RESULTS: We recruited 3,744 patients (mean age: 63 years; mean baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 66.7 mL/min; non-Kuwaitis: 42.3%), 
representing 3.2% of hospitalizations and 19.5% of intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions. Non-Kuwaitis were significantly younger (57.6 vs 66.9 years), with 
higher baseline eGFR (73.1 vs. 62 mL/min), more frequent community acquired AKI 
(53.8% vs 46.7%), and AKI in summer (34.7% vs 26.9%). Dialysis was provided to 
33.5% of patients, with a higher need for non-Kuwaitis (35.5% vs 32.1%). At 30 
days, 34.4% of patients died, representing 24.8% of hospital mortality and 59.8% 
of ICU mortality. No differences in mortality or kidney recovery were noted 
between Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis. Low eGFR did not affect the mortality rate.
LIMITATIONS: Observational nature and short follow-up period of 30 days only.
CONCLUSIONS: AKI was associated with high dialysis need and mortality. 
Non-Kuwaitis accounted for less cases despite representing 66% of the population 
because they were younger with higher baseline eGFR and fewer comorbid 
conditions. Non-Kuwaitis had higher rates of community acquired AKI and AKI in 
summer and a higher need for dialysis but had similar mortality and complete 
kidney recovery rates.

Plain Language Summary: Incidences of acute kidney injury (AKI), its management, 
and its outcomes are unknown in Kuwait. In addition, Kuwait has a large 
population of ethnically diverse expatriates who have lower income and do not 
enjoy the same level of access to public hospital services. We recruited 
hospitalized adults who have a diagnosis of AKI in several public hospitals in 
Kuwait. We analyzed characteristics, management, and outcomes data for more than 
3,700 patients and found that AKI affects 3.2% of hospitalized patients. AKI 
leads to high dialysis utilization rates and causes high mortality rates. 
Although more Kuwaitis were affected by AKI, the mortality rates for Kuwaitis 
and non-Kuwaitis were similar. Non-Kuwaitis were younger with better baseline 
kidney function and fewer chronic diseases than Kuwaitis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting 
28-day and 90-day mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) coexisting with congestive heart 
failure (CHF).
METHODS: An extensive analysis was conducted on clinical data from the Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, covering patients over 18 years 
old with both COPD and CHF, who were were first-time ICU admissions between 2008 
and 2019. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
method was employed to screen clinical features, with the final model being 
optimized using backward stepwise regression guided by the Akaike Information 
Criterion (AIC) to construct the nomogram. The predictive model's discrimination 
and clinical applicability were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, calibration curves, the C-index, and decision curve analysi s 
(DCA).
RESULTS: This analysis was comprised of a total of 1948 patients. Patients were 
separated into developing and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio, with similar 
baseline characteristics between the two groups. The ICU mortality rates for the 
developing and verification cohorts were 20.8 % and 19.5 % at 28 days, 
respectively, and 29.4 % and 28.3 % at 90 days, respectively. The clinical 
characteristics retained by the backward stepwise regression include age, 
weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation 
(SpO2), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), lactate, partial thrombosis 
time (PTT), race, marital status, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), malignant 
cancer, acute kidney failure (AKF), pneumonia, immunosuppressive drugs, 
antiplatelet agents, vasoactive agents, acute physiology score III (APS III), 
Oxford acute severity of illness score (OASIS), and Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI). We developed two separate models by assigning weighted scores to each 
independent risk factor: nomogram A excludes CCI but includes age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer, while nomogram B includes only CCI, without age, T2DM, and 
malignant cancer. Based on the results of the AUC and C-index, this study 
selected nomogram A, which demonstrated better predictive performance, for 
subsequent validation. The calibration curve, C-index, and DCA results indicate 
that nomogram A has good accuracy in predicting short-term mortality and 
demonstrates better discriminative ability than commonly used clinical scoring 
systems, making it more suitable for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram developed in this study offers an effective assessment 
of short-term mortality risk for ICU patients with COPD and CHF, proving to be a 
superior tool for predicting their short-term prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Lymphoma patients may require intensive care (ICU) due to disease- 
or treatment-related complications. The lymphoma-HIV interaction complicates 
management, but whether outcomes are worse in these patients, when critically 
ill, is unclear. A retrospective observational cohort study reviewed outcomes of 
patients admitted to ICU, subsequent 5-year survival, and prognostic factors.
SETTING: General ICU at the UK National Centre for HIV Malignancy.
METHODS: Records between 2007-2020, identified the following cohorts: HIV 
lymphoma, lymphoma-alone, HIV-alone and patients without HIV/lymphoma. Patient 
demographics, lymphoma characteristics, ICU admission data, and survival 
outcomes were collected. Five-year survival outcomes were analyzed for the 
lymphoma cohorts. ICU outcomes were analyzed for all cohorts. Descriptive 
statistics summarized baseline characteristics and outcomes. Multivariate 
regression identified factors associated with ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Of 5929 patients admitted to the ICU, 63 had HIV lymphoma and 43 had 
lymphoma-alone. Survival to ICU discharge was 71% and 72%, respectively. 
Adjusted log-odds ratio for ICU survival was significantly better in the 
comparator cohort. ICU survival between the HIV lymphoma and lymphoma-alone 
cohorts was not significantly different. Adjusted 5-year survival was not 
significantly different between lymphoma cohorts. Factors independently 
associated with a worse ICU survival prognosis were emergency admissions, APACHE 
II score, initial lactate, and day requiring level 3 support. Mechanical 
ventilation and higher APACHE II scores were independent risk factors for worse 
5-year survival in the lymphoma cohorts.
CONCLUSION: ICU outcomes and 5-year survival rates of lymphoma patients were 
unaffected by HIV status, revealing favorable outcomes in patients with 
HIV-related lymphoma admitted to the ICU.

Background and aim A variety of scoring systems are employed in intensive care 
units (ICUs) with the objective of predicting patient morbidity and mortality. 
The present study aimed to compare four different severity assessment scoring 
systems, namely, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), 
Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA), and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II (SAPS II) to predict prognosis 
of all patients admitted to a mixed medical ICU of a tertiary care teaching 
hospital in central India. Methods The prospective observational study included 
1136 patients aged 18 years or more, admitted to the mixed medical ICU. All 
patients underwent severity assessment using the four scoring systems, namely 
APACHE II, SOFA, REMS, and SAPS II, after admission. Predicted mortality was 
calculated from each of the scores and actual patient outcomes were noted. 
Receiver operating curve analysis was undertaken to identify the cut-off value 
of individual scoring systems for predicting mortality with optimum sensitivity 
and specificity. Calibration and discrimination were employed to ascertain the 
validity of each scoring model. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses among the study participants were conducted to identify the best 
scoring system, after adjusting for potential confounders. Results Final 
analysis was done on 957 study participants (mean (±SD) age-58.4 (±12.9) years; 
males-62.2%). The mortality rate was 14.7%. APACHE II, SOFA, SAPS II, and REMS 
scores were significantly higher among the non-survivors as compared to the 
survivors (p<0.05). SAPS II was found to have the highest AUC of 0.981 
(p<0.001). SAPS II score >58 had 93.6% sensitivity, 94.1% specificity, 73.3% 
PPV, 98.8% NPV, and 94.0% diagnostic accuracy in predicting mortality. This 
scoring system also had the best calibration. Binary logistic regression showed 
that all four scoring systems were significantly associated with ICU mortality. 
After adjusting for each other, only SAPS II remained significantly associated 
with ICU mortality. Conclusion Both SAPS II and APACHE II were observed to have 
good calibration and discriminatory power; however, SAPS II had the best 
prediction power suggesting that it may be a useful tool for clinicians and 
researchers in assessing the severity of illness and mortality risk in 
critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of sepsis and hematological malignancies increases 
patient vulnerability, revealing the need for precise prognostic markers. This 
study explores the prognostic significance of lactate levels and clearance in 
septic patients with hematological malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2016 to 
December 2019 in a tertiary hematological intensive care unit (ICU) included 167 
adults with hematological malignancies and sepsis. The relationship between 
lactate levels, hyperlactatemia, lactate clearance, and ICU outcomes was 
investigated. ICU survivors and non-survivors were compared to identify the 
factors affecting ICU mortality.
RESULTS: Patients were primarily with lymphoma and acute leukemia (66%) and had 
frequent hyperlactatemia (64%) on ICU admission. ICU non-survivors demonstrated 
higher lactate levels and hyperlactatemia frequency at various time points (0, 
6, and 12 h) than survivors. Lactate clearance and liver function tests did not 
differ significantly between the two groups. Invasive mechanical ventilation [OR 
(95% confidence interval-CI): 20.4 (2.4-79.8), p < 0.01], requirement of 
vasopressors [OR (95% CI): 5.6 (1.3-24.5), p < 0.01], lactate level at the 6th 
hour [OR (95% CI): 1.51 (1.1-2.07), p = 0.01], and APACHE II score (OR (95% CI): 
1.16 (1.01-1.34), p = 0.05) were independent risk factors for ICU mortality. The 
Area Under the Curve for APACHE II score and lactate level at the 6th hour were 
0.774 (95% CI: 0.682-0.866) and 0.703 (95% CI: 0.602-0.804), respectively.
CONCLUSION: While elevated lactate levels correlate with mortality rate and 
lactate level at the 6th hour is an independent risk factor for mortality, the 
absence of a significant difference in lactate clearance challenges traditional 
assumptions. These results question the commonly accepted perspective regarding 
lactate dynamics in sepsis among individuals with hematological malignancies.
